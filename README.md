🔭 *Currently*, I'm working on various projects related to my computer science studies. I enjoy diving into different programming languages and exploring their application in real-world scenarios.

🌱 I'm continuously *learning* and expanding my knowledge in languages like C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Dart, and Flutter. Additionally, I'm exploring development environments such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Windows Forms, Universal Windows Platform, and .NET.

👯 I'm open to *collaborating* on exciting projects that involve software development and problem-solving. Working in a team environment motivates me and allows me to learn from others.

🤔 If you have any expertise or resources related to Unity, React, Scratch, Android Studio, Java, C, Php, Kotlin, Swift, MatLab, or any other interesting technology, I'm eager to receive help and guidance in mastering those skills.

💬 Feel free to ask me about my experiences in university projects, personal coding endeavors, or anything related to programming and computer science. I'm always happy to share my knowledge and engage in discussions.
